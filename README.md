# PennyPilot

PennyPilot is a gamified financial planning web application designed to help users build better budgeting habits, track spending, and visualize savings goals. By integrating bank data via the Plaid API, users can link their accounts and automatically populate budget tables and charts. The app uses a combination of interactive visuals, progress tracking, and financial education tools to engage users and support long-term financial health.

## ðŸš€ Setup & Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get the project running locally for development or testing.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or above)
- Python 3.10+
- MySQL or PostgreSQL
- Virtual environment tool (e.g. `venv` or `virtualenv`)
- Plaid API keys
- AWS EC2 instance (for deployment)

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/pennypilot.git
```
### 2. Frontend Setup (React)
``` bash
cd pennypilot
npm install
npm run dev
```
### 3. Backend Setup (Flask + SQLAlchemy)
``` bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Environment Variables & Secrets

To run this project locally or in a deployment environment, you will need access to environment variables for services such as Plaid, Firebase, and the database connection.

Weâ€™ve provided a `.env.example` file in the root directory.
To get started:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to create your local `.env` file
2. Fill in the actual values by referencing project secrets stored in GitHub Secrets.
    - This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Sensitive keys are stored securely in GitHub Secrets, which are automatically injected during build and deployment workflows.
    - To request access:

Contact a project maintainer
Access is granted only to trusted collaborators with write/admin permissions

Once granted, secrets such as the following will be available in the Actions environment:

PLAID_CLIENT_ID

PLAID_SECRET

FIREBASE_API_KEY

DATABASE_URL

SECRET_KEY

These are not available to local development automatically. You must retrieve them securely and insert them manually into your local .env files using the .env.example template as a guide.


Run the backend server:
``` bash
flask run
```
### 4. Database Initialization
Ensure your local MySQL/PostgreSQL server is running.
``` bash
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
```
### 5. Deploying to AWS EC2
- see guide through this link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/deployment-steps-server.html

## Backend Documentation
---
## `models.py`
Defines the ORM models for the app using SQLAlchemy. Includes tables for Users, Linked Accounts, Transactions, Goals, Tax Info, Income, Expenses, Savings, Budget, and Access Tokens.
**Key points:**
- Uses SQLAlchemy declarative models linked with Flask app.
- Defines relationships between `User` and `LinkedAccount`.
- Each class corresponds to a database table with appropriate columns and data types.
- Automatically creates tables on app context.
---
## `schemas.py`
Marshmallow schemas for serialization and validation of API input/output data.
- Each schema corresponds to a model and defines required fields and validation.
- Includes schemas for User, LinkedAccount, Transaction, Goal, TaxInfo, Income, Expenses, Savings, Budget, and AccessToken.
- Fields include types such as String, Integer, Float, Date, with required flags.
- Schemas are instantiated at the bottom for use in route handlers.
---
## `key_utils.py`
Utility module for secure key storage and validation.
- Defines `KeyStorage` model for keys with salt and hashed keys.
- Generates random salt using `os.urandom`.
- Hashes keys with SHA-256 combining salt + key.
- Stores hashed keys in database.
- Validates input keys by comparing hashes.
---
## `config.py`
Flask app and extension configuration.
- Initializes Flask app, SQLAlchemy, Marshmallow, and CORS.
- Loads environment variables via `dotenv`.
- Configures database URI, disables SQLAlchemy event system tracking.
- Sets up CORS to allow cross-origin requests.
---
## `base.py`
Defines SQLAlchemy declarative base:
```python
import sqlalchemy as sa
from sqlalchemy.orm import declarative_base
Base = declarative_base()
```
---
## `app.py`
Main application entry point.
- Imports and initializes Flask app and database session.
- Imports and sets up routes for users, linked accounts, goals, tax info, transactions, Plaid integration, and home.
- Loads environment variables for SSL certificates.
- Runs Flask app with debug mode enabled.
---
## `setup_cred.py`
Initializes Firebase Admin SDK with service account credentials.
- Loads `.env` file using `dotenv`.
- Reads `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to get path to Firebase service account JSON.
- Uses `firebase_admin.credentials.Certificate` to initialize Firebase app.
**Environment variable:**
```bash
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/firebase-service-account.json
```
---
## `plaid_client_config.py`
Sets up the Plaid API client.
- Loads Plaid credentials (`CLIENT_ID`, `SECRET`, `ENV`) from environment variables.
- Defaults to Sandbox environment if none specified.
- Configures and instantiates Plaid API client using official SDK.
---
## `init_keys_table.py`
Script to create the `keys` table in the database.
- Uses `Base.metadata.create_all` with SQLAlchemy engine.
- Runs within Flask app context.
- Prints confirmation message once table is created.
---
## `jared_mock_data.py`
Populates the database with mock data for testing.
- Adds a user, linked account, transaction, goal, and tax info with fixed test values.
- Uses the Flask SQLAlchemy session.
- Commits data and closes session.
---
## `user.py`
Defines RESTful API routes for User resource.
- CRUD routes for users (`POST /users`, `GET /users/<id>`, `PUT /users/<id>`, `DELETE /users/<id>`).
- Validates request JSON against `UserSchema`.
- Commits changes to the database.
- Returns appropriate JSON messages and HTTP status codes.
---
## `transaction.py`
Defines RESTful API routes for Transaction resource.
- CRUD routes (`POST /transactions`, `GET /transactions/<id>`, `PUT /transactions/<id>`, `DELETE /transactions/<id>`).
- Validates input data with `TransactionSchema`.
- Performs DB operations and returns status messages.
---
## `tax_info.py`
RESTful routes for TaxInfo resource.
- Supports full CRUD operations.
- Validates requests with `TaxInfoSchema`.
- Handles multiple income fields and tax-related data.
---
## `savings.py`
RESTful API for Savings resource.
- Implements create, read, update, delete endpoints.
- Uses `SavingsSchema` for input validation.
- Persists data including amount, goal name, target, and date.
