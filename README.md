# Getting Started with PennyPilot (Develop Branch)

Welcome to the **PennyPilot** repo! This `develop` branch is the active working branch where all new features are created, tested, and reviewed before merging into production (`main`).

If youâ€™re a contributor, follow these steps to set up your environment and start working on your own feature branch.

## Step 2: Clone Your Fork

In your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pennypilot.git
cd pennypilot
git remote add upstream https://github.com/YourOrgOrUser/pennypilot.git
```

## Step 3: Create Your Feature Branch (From Develop)
Always branch off from the develop branch when working on a new feature.

```
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

## Step 4: Install Dependencies
Make sure you're in the root directory of the project, then run:
```
npm install
```
This will install all necessary packages in package.json.

If you're using yarn instead:
```
yarn install
```
## Step 5: Stay Updated with the develop Branch
To make sure your branch always has the latest changes:
```
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git merge develop
```
Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur.

## Step 6: Run the App Locally
Once everything is installed, run:
```
npm run dev
```
