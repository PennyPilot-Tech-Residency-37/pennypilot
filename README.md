# PennyPilot

PennyPilot is a gamified financial planning web application designed to help users build better budgeting habits, track spending, and visualize savings goals. By integrating bank data via the Plaid API, users can link their accounts and automatically populate budget tables and charts. The app uses a combination of interactive visuals, progress tracking, and financial education tools to engage users and support long-term financial health.

Environment Variables & Secrets

To run this project locally or in a deployment environment, you will need access to environment variables for services such as Plaid, Firebase, and the database connection.

Weâ€™ve provided a `.env.example` file in the root directory.
To get started:

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to create your local `.env` file
2. Fill in the actual values by referencing project secrets stored in GitHub Secrets.
    - This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Sensitive keys are stored securely in GitHub Secrets, which are automatically injected during build and deployment workflows.
    - To request access:

Contact a project maintainer
Access is granted only to trusted collaborators with write/admin permissions

Once granted, secrets such as the following will be available in the Actions environment:

PLAID_CLIENT_ID

PLAID_SECRET

FIREBASE_API_KEY

DATABASE_URL

SECRET_KEY

These are not available to local development automatically. You must retrieve them securely and insert them manually into your local .env files using the .env.example template as a guide.


Run the backend server:
``` bash
flask run
```
### 4. Database Initialization
Ensure your local MySQL/PostgreSQL server is running.
``` bash
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
```
### 5. Deploying to AWS EC2
